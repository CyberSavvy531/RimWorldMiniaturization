	<!-- FuelTankBase -->
	<!--
	    FuelTankBase inherits from GravshipComponentBase which is actually minifiable and categorizied be default, but FuelTankBase itself is manually overridden to null.
	    So these operations remove those overrides from FuelTankBase to allow the inherited values to take effect.
