Enables miniaturization (uninstall/reinstall) for several non-furniture items.

Known Bugs:
The mini-fied door sprite only shows half a door.  This is due to how Rimworld draws doors. 
Reinstalling an installed door can throw an error when the door is minified. No idea why, it seems to be a harmless error. This is only seen when in debug mode.

Compatibility:
This is a simple XML mod and should be easily compatible with already existing saves.

If you plan to remove the mod:
BE SURE TO REINSTALL OR DECONSTRUCT ANY MINI VERSIONS OF THE ABOVE BUILDINGS!
