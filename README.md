# RimWorld Miniaturization
A mod for RimWorld by Ludeon Studios that aims to allow more items to be "minifiable" a.k.a. uninstall/reinstallable.

## Installation:

I provide the master branch of this repo as a Steam Workshop mod for any who would prefer to manage their mods that way.

<ins>**INSTALL FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE**</ins>\
If you use the Steam Workshop, do not manually install one of the releases from here.\
If you wish to install from here, be sure to unsubscribe from the mod on the Steam Workshop.

There should be no issue in switching between the two platforms otherwise.

### Manual Installation:

1. Select the branch of your choice and download the source file
2. Extract that file into your `/RimWorld/Mods` folder
3. Done! The mod should be available to use when you load the game. Remember to actually enable it via the "Mods" menu at the title screen.
