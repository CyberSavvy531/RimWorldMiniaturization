# RimWorldMiniaturization
A mod for RimWorld by Ludeon Studios that aims to allow more items to be "minifiable" a.k.a. uninstall/reinstallable.

# Installation:

I provide the master branch of this repo as a Steam Workshop mod for any who would prefer to manage their mods that way.

**Install only from one source or the other.**
If you use Steam, do not manually install one of the releases from here.
If you wish to install from here, be sure to unsubscribe from the mod on the Steam Workshop.

## Manual Installation

1. Select the release of your choice and download the source file
2. Extract that file into your `/RimWorld/Mods` folder
3. Done! The mod should be available to use when you load the game. Remember to actually enable it via the "Mods" menu at the title screen.

## Different Versions (Currently vX.X.X and vX.X.X-d):

The only difference between these release tags is the version with "-d" appended at the end includes the ability to minify doors and autodoors. I've seen reports from users that raiders can steal the doors with this enabled, though, thus why I removed it from the master branch. I provide it here for manual installation for those who still want it.

If you do prefer the ability to uninstall doors, here's a link to a Steam Workshop mod I've seen reference that prevents raiders from stealing them:
